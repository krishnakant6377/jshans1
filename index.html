    <h1>JavaScript Assignment 1</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    Q.1) You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers.
    <br>
    Ans:
    <br>
    const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
    <br> return a+b;
    <br> };

    <br> <br>
    Q.2) You are given two numbers first as "A" and second as "B" and check if both conditions are ( A <10 and A> B )
        are satisfied or not with the help of operators.
        <br> Ans:
        <br> const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
        <br> if (a < 10 && a> b){
            <br> return true;
            <br> }
            <br> else {
            <br> return false;
            <br> }

            <br> };


            <br> <br>
            Q.3) You are given two numbers "A" and "B". <br>
            You need to do the following checks: <br>

            (i) if both are divisible by 10 console true. <br>
            (ii) if both are not divisible by 10 console false. <br>
            (iii) if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true. <br>

            Use operators to do this. <br>
            <br>
            Ans:
            <br> const Check = (A, B) => { <br>

            if (A % 10 == 0 && B % 10 == 0){ <br>
            return true; <br>
            }
            else if (A % 10 != 0 && B % 10 != 0){ <br>
            return false; <br>
            } <br>
            else { <br>
            return true; <br>
            } <br>

            }; <br> <br> <br>

            Q.4) You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the first digit of that number.
            <br>

            Ans : <br>
            const First_Digit = (n) => { <br>

            return parseInt(n/1000); <br>

            }; <br> <br> <br>



            Q.5) You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that number.
            <br>
            Ans: <br>
            const Last_Digit = (n) => { <br>

            return n%10; <br>

            }; <br> <br> <br>


            Q.6) You are provided with two numbers A and B where A as divisor and B as dividend.Your task is find the
            remainder. <br>

            Ans: <br>
            const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => { <br>

            return b%a; <br>

            }; <br> <br> <br>



            Q.7) You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to multiply these two numbers. <br>

            Ans: <br>
            const Multiply_two_number = (a,b) => { <br>

            return a*b; <br>

            }; <br> <br> <br>


            Q.8) Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as A , B , and C (out of 100).Write a program to calculate
            his total marks and his average. <br>
            Ans: <br>
            const Sum = (A, B, C) => { <br>

            return A+B+C; <br>

            }; <br>

            const Average = (A, B, C) => { <br>

            return (A+B+C)/3; <br>

            }; <br> <br> <br>
